    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used bt JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
        In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>

        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style shuld be applied.
